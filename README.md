Project Participants
- Ian Lee

Objective: Understand the Customer_database dataset
- Dataset was from 2021 with Doctor visit data($17.25 per visit)
- Used Decision Tree Regression Machine Learning to predict amount of visits/spending per year for type of pet
- A somewhat accurate model, running the best parameters, evaluation metrics are not entirely ideal because of the small dataset.
